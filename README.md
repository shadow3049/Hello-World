# Hello-World
Sentiment Analysis in C++

## My First C++ Project

This performs rule based sentiment analysis on a piece of text
You need to make a file with the contents to be analysed and give the file path as an input to the program.
The program will then read the data in the file and then give you a sentiment score.
