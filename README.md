Sentiment Analysis in C++

## My First C++ Project

This performs rule based sentiment analysis on a piece of text
You need to make a file with the contents to be analysed and give the file path as an input to the program.
The program will read the data inside the file and give you a sentiment score.
The file is being used so that the new line character and other breakers can be inputted as one string.
